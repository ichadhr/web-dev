**Update**: as I've modified my design since, this post isn't as relevant as before. But you can check the design in the repo.

As I've decided to design this blog without any image nor CSS 3 fancy feature (gradients & shadows particularly), I had to come up with a perfect color scheme, pleasing to read and visually balanced.

There are *millions* of predefined color [palettes](http://kuler.adobe.com/) [available](http://www.colourlovers.com/palettes) to download. And I'm bad at browsing and taking a quick decision with a whole world of options ahead of me.

So I had to find that *one* particular color theme that makes you forget all the others and regret not having found it before.

When looking for a performant JavaScript syntax highlighter, I discovered the exceptional [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/) (auto-detects the language, needs only 2 files) which provides a handfull of color styles. And one of them instantly caught my eye: **[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)**.

Its tagline reads as:

> Precision colors for machines and people

Precise, it is. Balanced, too. And gorgeous, hell yeah!
It's a color palette meant for terminal and gui applications, and works incredibly well as a theme for IDEs & text editors.

Why not make use for it in a *blog* theme?
