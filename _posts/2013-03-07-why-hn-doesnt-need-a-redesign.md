I don't exactly remember how I discovered Hacker News. [My account](http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bbx) is 1295 days old, which means I subscribed on August 20, 2009. HN's homepage on [that particular date](http://web.archive.org/web/20090820010834/http://news.ycombinator.com/) was filled with stories about \_why's disappearance which, in retrospect, is probably the event that led me to HN in the first place, considering I was learning Ruby at that time.

Anyway, I eventually created an account and stuck around. I first wondered why it was called *Hacker* News because at that time, the word still wrongly carried a negative connotation for me. Reading through pg's articles, I understood what *Hacker* actually meant.

Visually, the site's design felt slightly austere but it didn't bother me. I loved its straightforward approach: only links and text. That's hypertext at its core. No avatars, no background-image, no rich color palette, no custom font, no *stylish* elements. But most of all: a **high density of information**. I've always been more comfortable with having everything layed down before me, whether it's a digital interface or objects on my desk.

## A functional focus

Two days ago, the [HN Wishlist](http://hnwishlist.com/) appeared on HN's front page. It unsurprisingly spawned some discussion about HN's design. The 3rd most upvoted wish is [*Refresh the visual design*](http://hnwishlist.com/posts/87d7524a-a2c5-47c1-8d5b-91cd0dca882b).

As a designer, I can understand such a desire. But it misses the point: the web is about content, and HN is one of the few websites that has remained entirely focused on this notion.

A user browsing a news aggregator is here for 2 things: clicking links and reading/writing comments. Skimming through dozens of news on HN proves to be very efficient considering the links density and the lack of futile elements.

## A community filter

Maintaining what most people consider an *antique* layout actually prevents newcomers who can't see past the surface from deciding to join the community. The design also de-emphasizes the value of a user's profile. I believe both features have indirectly helped HN's community develop what it is often praised for: **high quality discussions**.

On a related note, the ability to collapse/expand comment threads is something some people wish for. But I fear it would give too much weight to top-level comments, and diminish the core of a thread: the discussion it generates, in which counterarguments and additional details prove to be equally or more important than the comment they're replying to.

As a side effect, whenever I decide to contribute to an HN thread, I find myself wondering for a few minutes if what I'm about to write is adding any value to the discussion. If so, I mull over the idea I'm about to develop, carefully construct my sentences (looking through dictionaries and French/English translation sites) and avoid posting too radical statements.

## The big picture

It may sound far-fetched to say that HN's design *directly* impacts how users will contribute to the site but it's actually all related. The orange header, the light yellow-grey background, the small font-size, the lack of graphics... They all amount to a bigger scheme that reflects both the mind of the site's author and the profile of its community members.

A design is more than a visual signature: it carries the *raison d'Ãªtre* of a website. And I'd be sceptical if HN's design suddenly changed because it'd necessarily imply a deeper mutation.
