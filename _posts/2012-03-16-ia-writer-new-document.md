iA Writer for iPhone [just came out](http://www.iawriter.com/). 0,79â‚¬ for both iPhone *and* iPad (that I plan on upgrading to iOS 5) apps? Instant download!

I haven't used it intensively yet but one thing that *really* bothered me (or at least surprised me for its lack of common sense) is that taping the "+" icon to create new document does **just** that. And I mean *only* that: it adds a new .txt file called "Document" *but doesn't open it*.

In what context would you want to create a document without the intent to actually begin writing in it ??

I personaly don't plan on filling my iCloud space with empty 0.1kb-sized documents.
