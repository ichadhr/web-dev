title: Adobe Kuler's analytics make it unusable
introduction: I use Firefox add-ons to block various useless scripts. It never prevented me from seamlessly browsing the web. Until now.

Adobe just released a new version of their color tool [Kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com). I was surprised though to stumble upon an empty page:

I tried to disable Adblock Plus, but what finally did the trick was to enable **Omniture**, which is basically Adobe's own analytics. Ghostery rightfully blocked this script because it's nothing more than yet another useless plugin.

It's the first time I visit a website that becomes unusable because of a blocked analytics script. Well, I guess I won't be visiting Kuler anytime soon.
