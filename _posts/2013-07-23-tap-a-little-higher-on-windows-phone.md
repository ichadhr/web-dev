title: Tap a little higher on Windows Phone
introduction: I was wondering why I kept failing to tap links correctly. Now I know why.

I recently purchased a [Nokia Lumia 620](http://www.nokia.com/global/products/phone/lumia620/). I owned an iPhone some years ago, but when it got stolen, I didn't feel the need to have a permanent internet access anymore. But recently I figured that owning a smartphone is ultimately benefitial, as long as you prevent yourself from installing any casual game or aimlessly browsing the web.

Anyway, I'm still very familiar with iOS. After I lost my iPhone, I purchased an iPad 1, an iPod Touch, and recently an iPad Mini. I still consider iOS the best mobile OS available, in terms of responsiveness, usability, and global appeal.

Like anything new though, I am pleased with my Windows Phone. Great hardware, live tiles, predictive typing, decent default apps (especially the Nokia GPS), iTunes-free administration... Apart from the radically different design approach, the recurrent issue I still encounter with my Windows Phone is to **tap too low**. If I want to tap on a link, I usually end up taping the one right below. I figured that WP's taping area is calibrated *exactly* on its location, meaning that, in order to tap on a link, my thumb has to cover it completely. On iOS, the calibration is slightly different: you need to tap a little below the link, which actually prevents your thumb from hiding the link you're trying to interact with.

I don't know which approach is the best but switching from one device to the other still yields some unexpected behavior.
