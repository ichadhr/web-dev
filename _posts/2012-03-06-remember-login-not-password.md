title: Remember login, not password
introduction: Why not let the browser remember the information I forget the most, and prevent him from creating a security issue?

I wish browsers would prompt me, not only to remember my password (which actually remember *both* login and password), but also my login *only*. The thing is, I don't mind having my login stored in my browser (and consequentially giving other users potential access to) because it can be (and sometimes is) publically known.

The problem I encounter is due to my quite common name: Jeremy Thomas. I'm French, but this name is not only common in France but in English-speaking countries too, which are more prone to hold early users of web apps, and thus early *subscribers*.

So I have to fall back on one of my nicknames, based upon my first: boomshanka (which is also widely-adopted). These are boomy, boomybx, bbx...

But again, username choice is often constrained by:

* availability (jthomas, jeremythomas, jeremyt... always taken)
* character count (boomy, bbx or jt, is almost always too short)
* special characters (spaces, underscores)
* required characters (like numbers, rare though)

So, among dozens of websites, I end up with a dozen of different logins which I would like my browser to remember, without compromising the security of having *also* my passwords stored.

Even the solution of forcing users to use their email as login isn't viable because it's terribly long to write.
