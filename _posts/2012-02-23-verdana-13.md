Building this new blog, I focused on only text and color. There is no single image in the CSS. I felt it was unnecessary to add weight to a static blog engine (Jekyll) whose purpose is to deliver a (very) fast experience. Plus, I like the challenge of designing with self-imposed constraints.

Having drastically narrowed down the graphic elements in my scope, I had to choose the *perfect* font with the *perfect* font-size. But perfect for what purpose? For reading of course.

So I went visiting some of favourite sites, or should I say, favourite (web) authors. I checked Paul Graham, Marco Arment, 37 Signals, Dan Cederholm and Doug Bowman. [Three](http://www.paulgraham.com) [of](http://37signals.com/svn) [them](http://v3.stopdesign.com) use the exact same font at the exact same size: Verdana in 13.

Yes: it's no serif font. Yes: it's not pretty. But it's so fucking comfortable to **read**. There's a reason for that: it was especially designed for the screen (and is probably the most famous of that kind).

That's like my today-self telling my old-stunning-graphics-FTW-self:

> Hey, form follows function remember?
