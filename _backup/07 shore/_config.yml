    excerpt: French Blog
    description: My first blog/website, launched in 2007. Itâ€™s powered by WordPress and has gone through 8 custom themes before reaching (I hope) its final form. It also acts as my primary portfolio, through which I mainly obtain my freelance contacts.

    excerpt: Digital Card
    description: The shortest domain I own. For a long time, it acted as a PHP url shortener, until I decided to turn it into a digital profile card that links to my main websites.

    excerpt: Trip Summary
    description: When a friend of mine asked me to go to South-East Asia with her, I immediately had in mind a website that would recount our trip, where each city would be granted a different design. Like many projects of mine, it quickly reached 80% completion, then was left aside for almost 2 years, before being finally launched.

    excerpt: Adventure Blog
    description: A friend decided to spend one year in Australia and asked me for a blog where she could share pictures and stories of her adventure. I ended up designing a simple WordPress theme and it remains to this day the first (and last) time I used Cufon to implement custom web fonts.

    excerpt: Free Tutorial
    description: I've been developing custom WordPress themes for more than 6 years, mostly blogs, portfolios, and corporate websites. Programmers can easily share and contribute to open source code. As a designer and front-end developer, my only option to give back to the community was to write a free tutorial for people to learn from.

    excerpt: Travel Books Publisher
    description: A friend of mine worked as an intern for a Parisian travel books publisher. She introduced me to her boss who was looking to create a website. I was helped by a friend who took care of the programming part, while I was focused on the design and the front-end.

    excerpt: Geek Gifts
    description: With a friend, we had the idea to launch a directory of fun and interesting gifts. So I built a simple WordPress theme that ended up teaching me a lot about custom PHP functions.

    excerpt: iPhone App
    description: I always wanted to build an iPhone app website. As the opportunity didn't present itself, I contacted the author of an app I was using and offered to build his website for free. This single page website introduced me to writing my own jQuery functions.
